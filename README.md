# Tech-Quiz-Test-Suite

This application demonstrates how to write both component and end-to-end tests to ensure the integrity of an application. In doing so, I learned how to target a specific class or div that is unique and can be called in my Cypress code to cause either a pass or fail in the test environment. A small hiccup happened after completing the component testing and attempting the e2e in which I had copied the code used for the componenet test but, because there were only 10 questions in the live environment, I was getting a fail because my code was looking for 20 questions (because that's what the test environment had). Once I recognized this and adjusted my loop to be 0 - 9, my test passed again and I could move on.
